# TimeTable-Scheduling

Genetic Algorithm based University Timetable Scheduling software.
- The main idea behind the project is to design a time-table for my university, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, and using that model to implement the system into several other institutions. The same model can also be used in other applications also like designing of examination schedules, and also designing of anytype of schedules, in case of events, in offices, et cetera.
- The output will be in the form of tuples containing {Batchwise_minigroups, Subject_allotted, Teacher_allotted, Timeslot_allotted, Room_allotted}
